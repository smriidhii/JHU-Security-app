# Security Web Application
## Application Background
Public safety has always been a concern for citizens, especially for those who live in bad neighborhoods.
We aim to provide users a precise way to view, report and be notified of security incidents. Our intended audience would mainly be Baltimore citizens, especially JHU students and faculty.
## Final Expected Functions
A security alert web app where users can view, score and report incidents in near neighborhoods. The app will also have social functions which allows users to discuss incidents and provide support to each other.
## How To Run It 
1. The application is deployed at https://security-jhu-app.herokuapp.com/ 
2. You can report an incident using the report button
3. You can sign-in using google sign-in
